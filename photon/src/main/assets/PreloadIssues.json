Influenza A (H3N2) viruses were the most frequently identified viruses. Almost all viruses characterized thus far this season have been similar to the components of the 2016–17 Northern Hemisphere trivalent and quadrivalent influenza vaccine formulations. All influenza viruses tested to date have been sensitive to the antiviral drugs oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir.","implications":"Vaccination is the primary method to prevent influenza illness and its complications. Health care providers should continue to recommend influenza vaccination to all unvaccinated persons aged ≥6 months now and throughout the influenza season. As an adjunct to vaccine, treatment with influenza antiviral medications is recommended for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at high risk for influenza-related complications. Antivirals can lessen severity and duration of illness and can reduce severe outcomes of influenza. Antiviral medications work best when administered early in the course of influenza illness.","tags":[{"tag":"Influenza"},{"tag":"Flu"},{"tag":"United States"}],"url":"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm655051a5.htm?s_cid=mm655051a5_w","content-ver":"1","schema-ver":"1","command":"add"},

The age-standardized prevalence of SJP remained high (range = 24.9%–26.5%) and stable during 2002–2014, but the absolute numbers continued to increase and in 2014 reached 14.6 million. Groups disproportionately affected by SJP included women, non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, those with a disability, those unable to work, and those with less than a high school education, fair/poor health, obesity, heart disease, diabetes, or serious psychological distress.","implications":"Two major objectives of the 2016 National Pain Strategy are 1) to take steps to reduce barriers to pain care, and 2) to increase patient knowledge of treatment options and risks. The CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain — United States, 2016, offers additional guidance on managing pain from arthritis. Health care providers and public health practitioners can begin implement the recommendations and improve pain care among adults with arthritis by prioritizing self-management education and appropriate physical activity interventions as effective, nonpharmacologic ways to reduce pain and improve health outcomes.","tags":[{"tag":"Severe Joint Pain"},{"tag":"Arthritis"},{"tag":"United States"}],"url":"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6539a2.htm?s_cid=mm6539a2_w","content-ver":"1","schema-ver":"1","command":"add"},
  {"issue-date":"2016-10-07","issue-vol":"65","issue-no":"39","title":"State-Specific Prevalence of Current Cigarette Smoking and Smokeless Tobacco Use Among Adults — United States, 2014","already_known":"Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States. In recent years, cigarette smoking prevalence has declined in many states; however, there has been little change in the prevalence of current smokeless tobacco use or concurrent use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco in most states, with prevalence increasing in some states.","added_by_report":"State-specific differences and disparities in any cigarette/smokeless tobacco use exist between sexes and among racial/ethnic groups. The highest prevalence of any cigarette and/or smokeless tobacco use in the United States was seen in West Virginia. The difference in prevalence of any cigarette and/or smokeless tobacco use across states spanned almost 21 percentage points, ranging from 11.3% in Utah to 32.2% in West Virginia. Any cigarette and/or smokeless tobacco use was higher among males than females in all 50 states. Non-Hispanic whites had the highest prevalence of cigarette smoking and/or smokeless tobacco use in eight states, followed by non-Hispanic persons of other races in six states, non-Hispanic blacks in five states, and Hispanics in two states.","implications":"The significantly higher prevalence of tobacco use among males and some racial/ethnic groups in several states underscores the importance of implementing comprehensive tobacco control and prevention interventions to reduce tobacco use and tobacco-related disparities across states, including increasing tobacco product prices, implementing and enforcing comprehensive smoke-free laws, warning about the dangers of tobacco use through mass media campaigns. Increasing access to evidence-based behavioral counseling and FDA-approved medication can also help reduce tobacco use, particularly in populations with high use prevalence.","tags":[{"tag":"Cigarettes"},{"tag":"Smoking"},{"tag":"Tobacco"},{"tag":"Adults"}],"url":"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6539a1.htm?s_cid=mm6539a1_w","content-ver":"1","schema-ver":"1","command":"add"},

However, there are few published reports of postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children.","added_by_report":"During January 2015–July 2016, a total of 158 travel-associated confirmed or probable cases of postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children aged <18 years were reported to CDC from U.S. states. The median age of the patients was 14 years, 88 (56%) were female, and five (3%) were pregnant. Most children with Zika virus disease had rash, and more than half had fever and rash. Two (1%) patients were hospitalized; none had Guillain-Barré syndrome, and none died.","implications":"Health care providers should consider a diagnosis of Zika virus disease in children who have an epidemiologic risk factor and clinically compatible illness and should counsel sexually active adolescents regarding the risk for congenital Zika virus infection and prevention of unintended pregnancies. Although Zika virus disease in children is typically mild, health care providers should be aware of the possibility of serious complications, such as neurologic manifestations, and should report all cases of Zika virus disease to their state or local health department.","tags":[{"tag":"Zika"},{"tag":"Children"},{"tag":"United States"}],"url":"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6539e2.htm?s_cid=mm6539e2_w","content-ver":"1","schema-ver":"1","command":"add"}

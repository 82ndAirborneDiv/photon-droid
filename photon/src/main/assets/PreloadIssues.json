The three most common forms of plague are bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic, with the majority of cases presenting as bubonic. Although the rarest form of plague (approximately 2% of reported cases), primary pneumonic plague has a high (≥93%) mortality rate when left untreated.","added_by_report":"The outbreak in Colorado represents the largest outbreak of pneumonic plague in the United States since 1924. The source of the outbreak was a dog with pneumonic plague, an atypical occurrence because dogs infected with Yersinia pestis generally are either asymptomatic or exhibit mild self-limiting febrile illness and are not considered a direct source of human infection. Four persons developed plague after exposure to the ill dog; one of the patients also had close contact with the index patient after he developed plague pneumonia, supporting possible human-to-human transmission. Diagnosis in the index case was delayed because of misidentification of a bacterial isolate as Pseudomonas luteola by an automated blood culture system. The spectrum of disease in this outbreak was broader than usual for pneumonic plague, with two of the four patients not requiring hospitalization, possibly as a result of self-administration of antibiotics or medical prescription of azithromycin, an antibiotic not recommended for plague.","implications":"Plague should be considered in the differential diagnosis of dogs with respiratory illness in areas where plague is endemic. The results of automated blood culture systems should be evaluated critically when rare diseases are suspected.

Healthy People 2020 targets were reached in seven states for reduced incidence of colorectal cancer and in 19 states for reduced incidence of cervical cancer.","added_by_report":"National cancer surveillance data indicate that 1,456,496 new cases of invasive cancer were diagnosed in the United States (excluding Arkansas and Minnesota) in 2010, an annual incidence rate of 503 cases per 100,000 among men and 405 among women, both lower than in 2009. As in 2009, cancer incidence rates were highest (455 per 100,000 persons) among black persons, largely reflecting higher rates of cancers of the prostate and female breast. By state, all-sites cancer incidence rates ranged from 380 to 511 per 100,000 population. Healthy People 2020 targets were reached in 15 states for reduced incidence of colorectal cancer and in 24 states for reduced incidence of cervical cancer.","implications":"Differences in cancer incidence reflect differences in the prevalence of cancer risk factors. Evidence-based interventions to reduce these differences can be enhanced through policy approaches such as the Affordable Care Act of 2010, which could increase access for millions of persons to appropriate and timely cancer preventive services such as help with smoking cessation, cancer screening, and vaccination against the human papillomavirus.","tags":[{"tag":"Cancer"},{"tag":"Invasive Cancer"},{"tag":"Surveillance"}],"url":"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/preview\/mmwrhtml\/mm6312a1.htm?s_cid=mm6312a1_w","content-ver":"1","schema-ver":"1"},

High poliovirus vaccination coverage can prevent circulating VDPV (cVDPV) outbreaks, but prolonged immunodeficiency-associated VDPV (iVDPV) infections will occur as long as oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is used.","added_by_report":"Although recent cVDPV outbreaks in two countries have apparently stopped, and the large outbreak in Nigeria has nearly stopped, outbreaks continue in Afghanistan and Somalia, and new outbreaks have been detected in Chad, Pakistan, and Yemen. Ten new prolonged iVDPV infections in eight countries were detected, with increasing numbers found in developing and middle-income countries. Since 2006, >97% of cVDPVs are type 2.","implications":"Circulating VDPV outbreaks can be prevented and controlled by high OPV coverage; however, only cessation of OPV use will prevent prolonged iVDPV infections. To address the continued global type 2 VDPV risk, the World Health Organization recommends 1) shifting from trivalent OPV (tOPV) to bivalent OPV (types 1 and 3) by April 2016, 2) including at least 1 dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine into routine immunization schedules worldwide, 3) maintaining strategic stockpiles of monovalent OPV, 4) developing a robust acute flaccid paralysis and poliovirus surveillance and response capacity, and 5) encouraging development of antiviral drugs to clear prolonged iVDPV infections.","tags":[{"tag":"Global"},{"tag":"Poliovirus"},{"tag":"Vaccination"}],"url":"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/preview\/mmwrhtml\/mm6311a5.htm?s_cid=mm6311a5_w","content-ver":"1","schema-ver":"1"},

IPV, administered by intramuscular injection, has not been used in campaigns because of concerns about the increased cost and operational complexity, potential reduction in coverage, and potentially lower caregiver acceptance.","added_by_report":"The first community-based IPV\/OPV campaign was conducted during December 14–18, 2013, in Kenya in response to a wild poliovirus type 1 outbreak. The campaign targeted an estimated 126,000 children aged ≤59 months who lived in five refugee camps and in communities surrounding the camps in five divisions near the Kenya-Somalia border. A survey estimated coverage with both vaccines at 92.8% in refugee camps and 95.8% in surrounding communities.","implications":"The Kenya experience has shown that combined IPV\/OPV campaigns are feasible and can achieve high coverage and community acceptance. Future IPV use in campaigns might consider the following: 1) conducting population-specific studies to guide social mobilization and delivery strategies, 2) assessing cold chain needs before and during the campaign, 3) allocating vaccination teams with skilled staff members and clear work duties to minimize errors, 4) addressing injection technique and cold chain during training of vaccinators and supervisors, and 5) using specific strategies to reach nomadic and other hard-to-reach populations.","tags":[{"tag":"Kenya"},{"tag":"Vaccination"},{"tag":"Poliovirus"}],"url":"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/preview\/mmwrhtml\/mm6311a4.htm?s_cid=mm6311a4_w","content-ver":"1","schema-ver":"1"},

Preimmigration screening for tuberculosis (TB) historically has been required before entry and has been demonstrated as effective in preventing importation of active TB. However, the 1991 U.S. screening algorithm was outdated. New TB screening requirements, known as the Culture and Directly Observed Therapy Technical Instructions (CDOT TB TI), were issued in 2007. CDOT TB TI use newer technologies and TB cultures to increase the diagnostic yield, and also require treatment in accordance with U.S. guidelines. Since 2007, CDC has been working to implement CDOT TB TI worldwide. ","added_by_report":"Implementation of CDOT TB TI is effectively complete. During 2007–2014, panel physicians began using the new screening algorithm in 147 of 151 jurisdictions. The diagnostic yield increased twofold to threefold, with approximately 1,100 cases of TB diagnosed worldwide during 2012; approximately 60% of these cases were smear-negative, but culture-positive, representing a gain in diagnostic yield with the new algorithm. Preliminary evidence suggests the percentage of persons with abnormal chest radiographs overseas, but negative sputum smears, who are diagnosed with TB upon arriving in the United States has decreased from approximately 7% to 1%–2%. Implementation also is temporally associated with a decline in reported cases of TB among foreign-born persons in the United States 1 year after their arrival. ","implications":"Successful implementation of CDOT TB TI demonstrates that rigorous diagnostic and treatment programs meeting international standards can be implemented in areas with high incidence of TB overseas. To further reduce the number of cases of TB among foreign-born persons, consideration might be given to extending screening to long-term visitors, developing strategies to address latent TB infection in the foreign-born, and strengthening U.S. follow-up for arriving persons identified overseas as being at risk for TB.

Four states (California, Texas, New York, and Florida) reported more than half (51.3%) of all TB cases reported in 2013. Although TB cases among foreign-born persons in the United States continued to decline, the rate of decline in TB incidence since 2012 among foreign-born persons (2.1%) lagged behind the rate of decrease among the U.S.-born (8.4%), causing the proportion of TB cases in foreign-born persons to continue to increase.","implications":"Ongoing surveillance, vigilance, and prevention activities are needed despite the decline.

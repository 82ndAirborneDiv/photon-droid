Of the four persons whose infection was laboratory-confirmed, two were hospitalized. Illness was highly correlated with exposure to dust during demolition of the exterior walls, and with the handling of contaminated debris away from the work site.",

Lung cancer incidence rates during 2005–2009 decreased more rapidly among men than among women and more rapidly among adults aged 35–44 years than among other age groups. As a result, differences in lung cancer incidence between men and women narrowed with decreasing age; among adults aged 35–44 years, men had slightly lower rates of lung cancer than did women.",

Among 58 persons for whom data are available, seven (12%) visited an emergency department and 34 (59%) visited a health-care provider; 66% of affected persons overall were aged ≤19 years. This report suggests that the time to onset of effects might be rapid, that children might be at higher risk for illness, and that harmful algal bloom–associated outbreaks occur during the warmer months.",
      "implications":"Untreated recreational waters with harmful algal blooms present a potentially severe health risk to humans and animals. Environmental control and prevention of blooms is needed.

In addition, among daily smokers, the average number of cigarettes smoked per day declined from 16.7 in 2005 to 14.6 in 2012 (p<0.05 for trend). During the same period, the largest increase in the percentage of ever smokers who quit (from 22.7% to 26.5% [p<0.05]) and the largest declines in smoking prevalence (from 24.4% to 17.3% [p<0.05]) were observed among persons aged 18–24 years.",

These shortages can lead to clinically significant micronutrient deficiencies among patients who depend on prolonged parenteral nutrition. Premature infants are especially vulnerable, and certain micronutrient deficiencies can be lethal.",

By 2011, about 45% of countries had not met the incidence target of <5 cases per million. As milestones toward eventual global measles eradication, the 2010 World Health Assembly endorsed a series of targets to be met by 2015.",

In 2012, annual reported measles incidence was 33 reported cases per million population, a decline of 77% from 146 cases per million population in 2000, and estimated measles deaths decreased 78%, from 562,400 to 122,000.

Annual vaccination provides the best protection against circulating influenza viruses and is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months. Estimates of seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) for preventing medically attended illness caused by pH1N1 influenza viruses have ranged from 50% to 80% in previous seasons.",

Against the predominant influenza pH1N1 virus, VE for all ages was 62%, with similar protection from medically attended illness across age groups.",

Persons aged ≥6 months who have not yet received the 2013-14 influenza vaccine should be vaccinated. Evidence of protection offered by the 2013-14 influenza vaccine supports the public health benefit of the recent expansion of annual seasonal influenza vaccination to all persons aged ≥6 months.",

Of fatal and ICU cases with laboratory-confirmed influenza occurring in persons aged <65 years, those aged 41–64 years with underlying medical conditions predisposing them to influenza complications have been disproportionately affected. Influenza vaccination and antiviral treatment have been underutilized in observed cases with overreliance on rapid diagnostic tests with poor sensitivity.",
      "implications":"Early recognition of influenza illness and initiation of empiric antiviral treatment as soon as possible is recommended for persons with preexisting conditions that place them at high risk for influenza complications.

This season has been more severe for young and middle-aged adults than in the most recent seasons. The second highest hospitalization rates have occurred in patients aged 50-64 years this season, and more than half of influenza-associated hospitalizations occurred in adults aged 18-64 years.",
      "implications":"Vaccination remains the most effective method to prevent influenza and its complications and is important for persons of all ages, not just the very young and old.
